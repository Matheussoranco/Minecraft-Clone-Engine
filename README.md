# Minecraft-Clone-Engine
This is a project for a serious game for a class i made on 2023-2. The project was supposed to be a RPG dungeon style game mixed with minecraft elements. I had Only six months to develop documentation, textures and the code by myself. Long-story short, the class was terrible, my software was not registered and i had no time to develop the game. The engine still end-up being something, so i'm publishing it here. Be free to use it as you please.

Here is a class that helped me a lot on the code and learning of unity and C#: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj8gt_92c-M

Note that i took inpiration on Sam's project, but my project was not finished and did not came out as intended, so just turned out as a minecraft clone sort of instead of :|
